Built-in in Locators

Locators are the central piece of Playwright's auto-waiting and retry-ability. In a nutshell, locators represent a way to find element(s) on the page at any moment.

These are the recommended built-in locators.

page.getByRole() to locate by explicit and implicit accessibility attributes.
